      "2. It is possible to do a Play Console internal test and share the app to your group of testers before the first evaluation of the app is carried out (which was my case) and, in this scenario, the in_app_review API (by Googles side) it's intended to not work or have a bug on it. \n",
      "\n",
      "By the docs we think that in all the scenarios in_app_review should works good, but in this case it don't. So when this second scenario occurs, the user's account ends up reaching the quota limit and even if the app goes up for a production version or for an open test, the account will continue for a certain time without displaying the in_app_review due to the quota limit exceeded in internal test.\n",

      "When you try to run your great plugin on an iOS app that uses Objective-C as the base language, it unfortunately will not build.  There seems to be some kind of linking error in the Flutter build system that doesn't allow Swift code to compile correctly on Objective-C apps.\n",

So it seemed that the dialog has been opened, but it is somehow in the background of the flutter activity or hidden. After a few times the flashing stopped and after waiting a bit it reappears. So I assume the quota was hit then. \n",
